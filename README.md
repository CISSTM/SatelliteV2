# CissTM Satellite V2 (python)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/CISSTM/SatelliteV2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/CISSTM/SatelliteV2)

This is the newer version of the CissTM satellite, it's written in Python (instead of NodeJS), because of compatebility issues.

## How to install
I really don't know, just that I've tested it with Python 3.6.5, initially it was written with Python 2.7 in mind, but there were some issues, so we moved to Python 3.
